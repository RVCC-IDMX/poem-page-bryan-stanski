        <div id="paragraphs">

        <p id="para1">Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
        <br>
        Life is but an empty dream!
        <br>
        For the soul is dead that slumbers,
        <br>
        And things are not what they seem.</p>

    
        <p id="para2">
        Life is real! Life is earnest!
        <br>
        And the grave is not its goal;
        <br>
        Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
        <br>
        Was not spoken of the soul.</p>

        <p id="para3">Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
        <br>
        Is our destined end or way;
        <br>
        But to act, that each to-morrow
        <br>
        Find us farther than to-day.</p>

        <p id="para4">Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
        <br>
        And our hearts, though stout and brave,
        <br>
        Still, like muffled drums, are beating
        <br>
        Funeral marches to the grave.</p>

        <p id="para5">In the world’s broad field of battle,
        <br>
        In the bivouac of Life,
        <br>
        Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
        <br>
        Be a hero in the strife!</p>

        <p id="para6">Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!
        <br>
        Let the dead Past bury its dead!
        <br>
        Act,— act in the living Present!
        <br>
        Heart within, and God o’erhead!</p>

        <p id="para7">Lives of great men all remind us
        <br>
        We can make our lives sublime,
        <br>
        And, departing, leave behind us
        <br>
        Footprints on the sands of time;</p>

        <p id="para8">Footprints, that perhaps another,
        <br>
        Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
        <br>
        A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
        <br>
        Seeing, shall take heart again.</p>

        <p id="para9">Let us, then, be up and doing,
        <br>
        With a heart for any fate;
        <br>
        Still achieving, still pursuing,
        <br>
        Learn to labor and to wait.</p>
